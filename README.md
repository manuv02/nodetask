# nodetask

to see a demo of this api firs you have to create a folder and then npm install axios and npm install express
then you run the index.js file which is the api 

then to begin the demo you have to open index.html and you can delete a product record and reat the database


NOTE: this is by no means a perfect or the complete assigment and there are little error checks in the code
And for now you can only update or delete a particular record of a product 
and you can only read the whole database


The database is the db.json file which in which there is a products object which is an array with product object
Inside which there is productmodel and categorymodel

The api works by just getting the db file and parsing it as json with the frontend input 
And then writing the edited json to the file again




Thankyou for reading
